                            I am currently enrolled  at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology and am excited to get experience in the software enginnering work area. After graduating from high school I went to college at HACC for over a year for CIS before realizing that I was interested in a more specialized degree. The time I spent at HACC for CIS taught me some valuable information about computers and coding that helped me decide to choose the path that I'm taking today.

                        <p class="workExp">I began working at a Giant grocery store just as the pandemic began. I gained a lot of respect for how much effort it takes to maintain a job full time job while balancing a personal life and family. I worked at Giant for nearly 2 years while the pandemic was at its peak and solidified the fact that I wanted a more secure job that challenged by abilities.</p>
